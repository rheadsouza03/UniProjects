### Minor notes when using the program:
 - You do not need to make any plaintext.txt manually, they are temporarily created in the code. If you want to 
   test different file sizes, then make sure to add the file size to the file size array and updated the input file 
   length appropriately.
 - If you run the code multiple times, the information will just keep appending onto then end of the 'results.csv' 
   file. So, delete the 'results.csv' file before rerunning the program.
 - These programs will need to be run via the command-line as IDEs seem to flag the multiple 
   Util classes as an error, even though they are in different folders.
